=head1 NAME

DMTF::CIM::Instance::Property - Provides access to properties from a L<DMTF::CIM::Instance>


=head1 VERSION

This document describes DMTF::CIM::Instance::Property version 0.03


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DMTF::CIM::WSMan;
  my $cim=DMTF::CIM::WSMan->new();

  my $instance = $cim->get('wsman.wbem://host:623/interop:CIM_ManagedElement.InstanceID=1');

  print $instance->class,"\n";
  foreach my $prop ( $instance->defined_properties ) {
	  my $prop = $instance->property($prop);
      print "$prop: ",$prop->value,"\n";
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is returned by the property method of L<DMTF::CIM::Instance> 
It is not expected to be used by itself.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item C<< new ( [ property=>I<property_def> ] [, value=>I<valueref> ] ) >>

Creates a new property with the CIM property description I<property_def>
and a value stored at I<valueref>.

=item C<< name >>

Returns the name of the property using the defined case.

=item C<< value ( [ I<newvalue> ] ) >>

If the I<newvalue> list is specified, sets the value to that.  Returns the
current mapped value.  If the property is an array, and the method is used
in a scalar context, the values are join(', ')ed.

=item C<< raw_value ( [ I<newvalue> ] ) >>

If the I<newvalue> list is specified, sets the value to that.  Returns the
current unmapped value.  If the property is an array, and the method is used
in a scalar context, the values are join(', ')ed.

=item C<< is_array ( I<property> ) >>

Returns a true value equal to the length of the array if the named property
is an array or 0 otherwise.  A zero-length array returns '0 but true'

=item C<< is_ref ( I<property> ) >>

Returns true if the named property is a reference or false otherwise.

=item C<< type ( I<property> ) >>

Returns the type name of the specified property.  If the property is an
array, will have '[]' appended.  For properties which have no type information
in the instance, the type is assumed to be 'string'.

CIM types as of this writing are:

=over
